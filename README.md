# Mini Project

In this mini-project, I have introduced CQRS with a Clean Architecture pattern using Express.Js (API) with Typescript. In the frontend application, I have introduced the MVVM pattern using React.js with Typescript.

So, guys, this is not a full-fledged project but you will get to understand that how can we use the Architecture patterns & SOLID principle in the project. 
I always use the above-said architecture pattern in my client projects. This architecture pattern will help you to write maintainable code.

I hope you like it.

Note: Still mini-project is under construction.
